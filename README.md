Hey y'all, I'm Shuvam! I'm a Software Enginner by profession currently working in Amazon, India. Before this I did my internship with Dunzo (a hyperlocal stratup) working in python and react Js. Here was when I first fall in love with front end and am still trying to learn more about Javascript. Apart from this I love sports and prefer to spend most of my time on the field rather on the chair infront of the mac. 

I started a company few months back with some of my friends to provide Software solution for FHIR, [link](http://alstonia.io/). Also I love writing my experinces in this [blog](shuvam07.github.io) and [here](https://medium.com/chasing-dreams).
